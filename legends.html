<font color="white" face="tahoma" size="2"><b>The Legend of the Pyramid of the Magician</b>
Legend held that when a certain gong was sounded, the town of Uxmal
would fall to a boy "not born of woman". One day, a dwarf boy, who had
been raised from an egg by a witch, sounded the gong and struck fear
into the ruler, who ordered him to be executed. The ruler promised that
the boy&#8217;s life would be saved if he could perform three impossible
tasks, one of which was to build a giant pyramid in a single night. The
boy achieved all the tasks, and became the new ruler.

<font color="white" face="tahoma" size="2"><b>The Destiny of Quetzalcóatl</b>It
was probably the Toltecs who superimposed their cultural hero Topiltzin
Quetzalcóatl, the legendary king of the city of Tula, upon the ancient
and mysterious deity represented as the Feathered Serpent.&nbsp; Two
intertwined legends recount the destiny of this hero after his
expulsion from Tula.&nbsp; According to Toltec history, in 987AD the
legendary ruler Quetzalcóatl was dethroned by the evil Tezcatlipoca and
expelled from Tula.&nbsp; It was believe, that he emigrated to the east
with a group of followers, reaching the Yucatán region, probably by
sea.&nbsp; In the same year, Mayan stories recorded the arrival of a
king named Kukulkán, which in the Yucatec language means
&#8220;Serpent-Quetzal&#8221; or &#8220;Feathered Serpent&#8221;, whose return had been
expected.&nbsp; Kukulkán defeated the Mayan city tribes, and made
Chichén Itzá his capital.&nbsp; He is said to brought great knowledge
to Chichén Itzá.

<font color="white" face="tahoma" size="2"><b>Human Sacrifice</b>In
"Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas and Yucatan" (two
volumes, 1843) John Lloyd Stevens recounts stories of the human
sacrifices performed at the highest temple of the House of the
Magician. With the victim still alive, the priest would rip out the
heart with a flint knife, and throw the body (allegedly still moving)
down the steep steps.<br> <br>
&nbsp;
There are stories of sacrificial victims being thrown into the
&#8220;cenotes&#8221; (see Chitchén Itzá) along with offerings of treasure.&nbsp;
The &#8220;sacred cenotes&#8221; are very deep wells where selected victims (humans
and animals) and a variety of rich offerings were thrown to placate the
rain god Chac-Tlaloc in times of drought.&nbsp; It was believe that the
rain god Chac-Tlaloc preferred children victims, because their tears
stimulated the rain.&nbsp; Mayas also thought that these sacrifices
were a means of access to the Xibalbá, the Maya kingdom of the
Underworld.&nbsp; <br> <br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;In 1901 an American, Edward Thompson, bought the land around the
site and proceeded to dredge the "cenote". He found jewelry, pottery,
figurines, and the bones of many humans, mostly children. An
international dispute arose when he shipped the findings to the Peabody
Museum at Harvard, where some still remain (the remainder have since
been returned to the Mexicans). The evidence, however, was
inconclusive, as it was feasible that children were most likely to fall
into the cenote during play rather than as a deliberate act of
sacrifice.<br> <br>
&nbsp;
In the Ball Game there were also sacrifices.&nbsp; Some people think
the captain of the losing side was decapitated by the winner; others
suggest that the winners earned an honorable sacrifice. No one knows
for sure. It is said that the game was used either as a method of
settling disputes, or as an offering to the gods, perhaps in times of
drought. Only the best were selected to play, and to be sacrificed in
this way was a great honor. <br> <br>
&nbsp;
Nowadays, in Piste and other regions in the Yucatán Peninsula, peasants
still do rituals to the rain god Chac-Tlaloc in times of drought. But
instead of having human sacrifices, they offer food to the god.&nbsp;
The participation of children is very important, children sing like
frogs, announcing the coming of the rain.&nbsp;Also, four members of
the community stand up around the table where the food is, waving
machetes vigorously to produce the sound of a storm while the leader of
the ceremony prays. <br> <br>
