color=white>According to archeological investigations Uxmal has existed since as early as the Preclassic Period, but it was not until centuries later, between AD 800 and 1000, the Terminal Classic Period, that they began to develop into important centers.  Located in the Puuc Hills of Yucatán, it was the capital of this region.


The name Uxmal means 'thrice-built' in Mayan, referring to the construction of its highest structure, the


Pyramid of the Magician. The Maya would often build a new temple over an existing one, and in this case five stages of construction have actually been found.  Uxmal was one of the largest cities of the Yucatán Peninsula.    </p></td></tr>

color=white>  Uxmal is considered one of the masterpieces of Mayan architecture, represents the apogee of the Puuc style, that develops new sophisticated and elegant forms, known as Puuc after the name of the region.  Defining characteristics of the Puuc design are the quadrangles of monumental buildings faced with limestones, their doorways framed by round columns with square capitals, and elaborate mosaics on the upper façades of the buildings with motifs such as frets, lozenges, stylized animals, and half-columns forming friezes similar to elaborate textiles.  Carvings most commonly found include serpents, latticework and masks of the god Chac. </p>

color=white>Chac, the god of rain, was greatly revered by the Maya at Uxmal because of the lack of natural water supplies in the city.  Although Yucatán has no surface rivers, most Maya cities, including Chichén Itzá, used "cenotes" or sinkholes to access underground water; however, there were no "cenotes" at Uxmal. It was necessary to collect water in "chultunes" or cisterns, built in the ground.   On the other hand, the proximity of the Puuc hills, with comparatively rich soil from the hilltop forests, was washed down the slopes during rainstorms, making the area one of the most successful agricultural regions of Yucatan.  Uxmal is perhaps the center that achieved the greatest political and economic development in the Puuc area. There is a Ball court in Uxmal. (See Chitchén Itzá) </p></td></tr>

<b>The Pyramid of the Magician</b> <br>


The oval design, elliptical base of the Temple of the Magician, or the House of the Dwarf, is unusual in Mayan architecture.  It is 117 feet high, and this pyramid is the result of five superimposed temples. Parts of the first temple can be seen when ascending the western staircase; the second and third are accessed by the eastern staircase, in an inner chamber at the second level. The fourth temple is clearly visible from the west side, a giant Chac mask, richly decorated, marks the entrance and Chac's mouth is the door.  There are a series of Chac masks on the sides of the stairway.  At the top of the east stairs is the fifth temple and a view of the whole site.</p>

color=white><b>The Nunnery Quadrangle</b><br>


This collection of four buildings around a quadrangle was named "El cuadrángulo de las Monjas" (The Nunnery Quadrangle) by the Spanish, because the 74 small rooms around the courtyard reminded them of nuns' quarters in a Spanish convent. Each of the four buildings stand on different levels and vary in form and design, considered as one of the most beautiful architectural complexes ever produced.  The northern building is the oldest and the grandest; with many typical Puuc ornaments - Chac masks arranged one over another vertically, serpents, and latticework. The building to the east and closest to the Temple of the Magician is the best preserved, with a stack of Chac masks over the central doorway and serpents above the doorways to the left and right. The exact purpose of the group is not known; though, given the size and importance of the site, it is thought likely to have housed visiting dignitaries or administrative offices.  The lowest of them is the South building, constructed on the same level as the interior patio at the entrance, which is in shape of a Mayan dome (false arch).  </p></td></tr>

color=white><b>The Palace of the Governor</b><br>


Regarded by many experts as the best example of Puuc architecture in existence, due to its abundant ornamentation.  The Palace of the Governor stands on an artificial raised platform and is thought to be one of the last constructed buildings on the site. The structure has a typical plain lower section and a richly carved upper. Amongst the depictions are serpents, lattices, and masks and also a central seated god-like figure with a long plumed head-dress. </p>

Originally nine levels high, the Great Pyramid has been partially restored. It seems that another temple was to be superimposed on the existing structure and some demolition had taken place before the plans were halted, leaving the pyramid in bad condition. However, you can still see Puuc-style stonework on the façade.
